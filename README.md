# hellow-world
github tutorial

My name is Frank Griffitts.   I'm making this entry in the readme.md file as part of a tutorial provided by github on how to use branches.  This branch is hellow-world/readme.md.  It looks like I inadvertently misspelled "hello" when I typed in the name of this repository.  Typical.  

From what I can tell, a designer/developer can have an unlimited number of repositories (repos) on github.  When making changes to a master repository, it is best to make an instance of the repo.  The copy instance is called a "branch."

I'm writing this detailed message because I  have a horrendously awful memory and I will forget that I ever did this by the day after tomorrow.  Maybe if I include some details here, it will jog my memory if I come back to see what this file is.

The date is 12/30/2016.  I am exploring options of using github to host pieces of code for a vr viewer to embed on other websites.  At this point, I'm still not even sure if that is possible or not because I'm not a developer.  Well, here's to learning something new!
